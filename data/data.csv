usable on their own nlp ipynb A Jupyter IPython notebook that explains and gives examples of how to use the code nlp_apps ipynb A Jupyter notebook that gives example applications of the code Python 3 4 and up This code requires Python 3 4 or later and does not run in Python 2 You can install Python https www python org downloads or use a browser based Python interpreter such as repl it https repl it languages python3 You can run the code in an IDE or from the command line with python i filename py where the i option puts you in an interactive loop where you can run Python functions All notebooks are available in a binder environment http mybinder org repo aimacode aima python Alternatively visit jupyter org http jupyter org for instructions on setting up your own Jupyter notebook environment There is a sibling aima docker https github com rajatjain1997 aima docker project that shows you how to use docker containers to run more complex problems in more complex software environments Installation Guide To download the repository git clone https github com aimacode aima python git Then you need to install the basic dependencies to run the project on your system pip install r requirements txt You also need to fetch the datasets from the aima data https github com aimacode aima data repository cd aima python git submodule init git submodule update Wait for the datasets to download it may take a while Once they are downloaded you need to install pytest so that you can run the test suite pip install pytest Then to run the tests py test And you are good to go Index of Algorithms Here is a table of algorithms the figure name of the algorithm in the book and in the repository and the file where they are implemented in the repository This chart was made for the third edition of the book and is being updated for the upcoming fourth edition Empty implementations are a good place for contributors to look for an issue The aima pseudocode https github com aimacode aima pseudocode project describes all the algorithms from the book An asterisk next to the file name denotes the algorithm is not fully implemented Another great place for contributors to start is by adding tests and writing on the notebooks You can see which algorithms have tests and notebook sections below If the algorithm you want to work on is covered don t worry You can still add more tests and provide some examples of use in the notebook Figure Name in 3rd edition Name in repository File Tests Notebook 2 Random Vacuum Agent RandomVacuumAgent agents py agents Done Included 2

Supporting supporting 5 Acknowledgments acknowledgments Non tech crash course into Operaç o Serenata de Amor What Serenata de Amor is an open project using artificial intelligence for social control of public administration Who We are a group of people who believes in _power to the people_ motto We are also part of the _Data Science for Civic Innovation Programme_ from Open Knowledge Brasil http br okfn org Among founders and long term members we can list a group of eight people – plus numerous contributors from the open source and open knowledge communities Tatiana Balachova https tatianasb ru Felipe Cabral https twitter com felipebcabral Eduardo Cuducos https cuducos me Irio Musskopf https iriomk com Bruno Pazzim http brunopazzim com Ana Schwendler http anaschwendler com Jessica Temporal http jtemporal com Yasodara Córdova https twitter com yaso and Pedro Vilanova https twitter com pedrovilanova How Similar to organizations like Google Facebook and Netflix we use technology to track government spendings and make open data accessible for everyone We started looking into data from the Chamber of Deputies Brazilian lower house but we expanded to the Federal Senate Brazilian upper house and to municipalities When Irio had the main ideas for the project in early 2016 For a few months he experimented and gathered people around the project September 2016 marks the launching of our first crowd funding https catarse me serenata Since then we have been creating open source technological products and tools as well as high quality content on civic tech on our Facebook https fb com operacaoserenatadeamor and Medium https medium com serenata Where We have no non virtual headquarters but we work remotely everyday Most of our ideas are crafted to work in any country that offers open data but our main implementations focus in Brazil Why Empowering citizens with data is important people talk about _smart cities_ _surveillance_ and _privacy_ We prefer to focus on _smart citizens_ _accountability_ and _open knowledge_ Tech crash course into Operaç o Serenata de Amor What Serenata de Amor develops open source tools to make it easy for people to use open data The focus is to gather relevant insights and share them in an accessible interface Through this interface we invite citizens to dialogue with politicians state and government about public spendings Who Serenata s main role is played by Rosie rosie README md she is an artificial intelligence who analyzes Brazilian congresspeople expenses while they are in office Rosie can find suspicious spendings and engage citizens in the discussion about these findings She s on Twitter https twitter com RosieDaSerenata To allow people to visualize and make sense of data Rosie generates we have created Jarbas jarbas README md On this website users can browse congresspeople expenses and get details about each of the suspicions It is the starting point to validate a suspicion How We have two main repositories on GitHub https github com okfn brasil This is the _main repo_ and hosts Rosie rosie README md and Jarbas jarbas README md In addition we have the toolbox https github com okfn brasil serenata toolbox a pip installable package Yet there are experimental notebooks https github com okfn brasil notebooks maintained by the community and our static webpage https github com okfn brasil serenata website When Despite all these players acting together the core part of the job is ran manually from time to time The only part that is always online is Jarbas – freely serving a wide range of information about public expenditure 24 7 Roughly once a month we manually run Rosie and update Jarbas A few times per year we upload versioned datasets accessible via the toolbox – but we encourage you to use the toolbox to generate fresh datasets whenever you need Where Jarbas is running in Digital Ocean https digitalocean com droplets and deployed using the Docker Cloud https cloud docker com architecture Why The answer to most technical _why_ questions is because that is what we had in the past and enabled us to deliver fast We acknowledge that this is not the best stack ever but it has brought us here Contributing with code and tech skills Make sure you have read the _Tech crash course_ on this page Next check out our contributing guide CONTRIBUTING md Supporting Join our recurring

Getting Started First get the code on your system The simplest method is via git git installation instructions https gist github com derhuerst 1b15ff4652a867391f03 cd git clone https github com MycroftAI mycroft core git cd mycroft core bash dev_setup sh This script sets up dependencies and a virtualenv about virtualenv If running in an environment besides Ubuntu Debian Arch or Fedora you may need to manually install packages as instructed by dev_setup sh about virtualenv https virtualenv pypa io en stable NOTE The default branch for this repository is dev which should be considered a work in progress If you want to clone a more stable version switch over to the master branch Running Mycroft Mycroft provides start mycroft sh to perform common tasks This script uses a virtualenv created by dev_setup sh Assuming you installed mycroft core in your home directory run cd mycroft core start mycroft sh debug The debug command will start the background services microphone listener skill messagebus and audio subsystems as well as bringing up a text based Command Line Interface CLI you can use to interact with Mycroft and see the contents of the various logs Alternatively you can run start mycroft sh all to begin the services without the command line interface Later you can bring up the CLI using start mycroft sh cli The background services can be stopped as a group with stop mycroft sh Using Mycroft Home Device and Account Manager Mycroft AI Inc maintains a device and account management system known as Mycroft Home Developers may sign up at https home mycroft ai By default mycroft core is configured to use Home By saying Hey Mycroft pair my device or any other request verbal request you will be informed that your device needs to be paired Mycroft will speak a 6 digit code which you can enter into the pairing page within the Mycroft Home site https home mycroft ai Once paired your unit will use Mycroft API keys for services such as Speech to Text STT weather and various other skills Skills Mycroft is nothing without skills There are a handful of default skills that are downloaded automatically to your opt mycroft skills directory but most need to be installed explicitly See the Skill Repo https github com MycroftAI mycroft skills welcome to discover skills made by others And please share your own interesting work Behind the scenes Pairing

Weather Skill API OpenWeatherMap http openweathermap org api Wolfram Alpha Skill http products wolframalpha com api Using Mycroft behind a proxy Many schools universities and workplaces run a proxy on their network If you need to type in a username and password to access the external internet then you are likely behind a proxy If you plan to use Mycroft behind a proxy then you will need to do an additional configuration step _NOTE In order to complete this step you will need to know the hostname and port for the proxy server Your network administrator will be able to provide these details Your network administrator may want information on what type of traffic Mycroft will be using We use https traffic on port 443 primarily for accessing ReST based APIs _ Using Mycroft behind a proxy without authentication If you are using Mycroft behind a proxy without authentication add the following environment variables changing the proxy_hostname com and proxy_port for the values for your network These commands are executed from the Linux command line interface CLI bash export http_proxy http proxy_hostname com proxy_port export https_port http proxy_hostname com proxy_port export no_proxy localhost 127 0 0 1 localaddress localdomain com 0 0 0 0 1 Using Mycroft behind an authenticated proxy If you are behind a proxy which requires authentication add the following environment variables changing the proxy_hostname com and proxy_port for the values for your network These commands are executed from the Linux command line interface CLI bash export http_proxy http user password proxy_hostname com proxy_port export https_port http user password proxy_hostname com proxy_port export no_proxy localhost 127 0 0 1 localaddress localdomain com 0 0 0 0 1 Getting Involved This is an

native code communicating directly with Java Minecraft If you only need this functionallity then please see MalmoEnv https github com Microsoft malmo tree master MalmoEnv This will most likely be the preferred way to develop with Malmo Minecraft going forward If you wish to use the native Malmo implementation either install the Malmo native Python wheel if available for your platform or a pre built binary release more on these options below Building Malmo yourself from source is always an option Advantages 1 No native code you don t have to build or install platform dependent code 2 A single network connection is used to run missions No dynamic ports means it s more virtualization friendly 3 A simpler multi agent coordination protocol One Minecraft client instance one single port is used to start missions 4 Less impedance miss match with the gym api Disadvantages 1 The existing Malmo examples are not supported as API used is different Marlo envs should work with this port https github com AndKram marLo tree malmoenv 2 The API is more limited e g selecting video options can edit mission xml directly Malmo as a native Python wheel On common Windows MacOSX and Linux

ignore this don t wait for 100 As long as a Minecraft game window has opened and is displaying the main menu you are good to go By default the Mod chooses port 10000 if available and will search upwards for a free port if not up to 11000 The port chosen is shown in the Mod config page To change the port while the Mod is running use the portOverride setting in the Mod config page The Mod and the agents use other ports internally and will find free ones in the range 10000 11000 so if administering a machine for network use these TCP ports should be open Launch an agent Running a Python
